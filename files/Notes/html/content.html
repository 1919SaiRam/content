How the web works? 
You type a URL in your browser.
Browser sends a message to a server.
Server understands the message.
Server sends a message back to your browser.
Browser reads the message
If there is any other information needs, it agains asks the server for it
This process is repeated several times till the browser has complete info.
Browser renders a web page on screen

Intro to web development
Two broad divisions - Client-side and Server-side 
Client = Your browser
Server = Other computer where the resources live.
Front-End = Whatever displayed on the screen!
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) - The Structure
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - the styling
JS (JavaScript) - the functionality


Full-stack Dev Overview
Creating a front-end website for 
end-users.
Creating a database to store the data 
for the frontend.
Creating an application to connect 
front-end to database.
Deploying the website/web-app 
to cloud servers.


What is HTML?
Stands for HyperText Markup Language
Standard markup language for creating web pages
Responsible for structure of website/webpage
Made up of elements -> which tell the browser what and how to display
Contains all information like
Structure (Elements)
Content
Styles
Fonts etc...



Let’s understand one use case
We need to display some content on our webpage.
But the question is how can we mark up the content for user agents  (explain our content to browsers, screen readers etc) so they can deliver a better experience to the users  ?


HTML Elements & Tags
Everything in HTML is made up of elements
Element = Start tag (<tag>) + Content (text) + End Tag (</tag>)
Tag: Tells browser the type of the content in the element - image, input, button, text?
Start Tags: <tagName>, End Tags: </tagName>
There are a bunch of tags in HTML - some mandatory, some optional.


Structure of a page
Code

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
		
    </body>
</html>

The <html>, <head>, and <body> are known as Tags

Best practice - Start your HTML files with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell the browser which kind of document to expect.

  
<html>, <head>, & <body>
Every HTML page will (generally) have the html, head, and body tag.
<html> tag encloses all the page content
Hence it is also called the root element.
<head> tag defines the metadata (data about data *) of the page
Like title (which is displayed on browser tab) using the <title> tag
Meta tag which can be used to defined author and keywords for the page
Fonts for the page
Styles etc.
<body> tag contains the content which is displayed inside the browser window as a page.



  Code Demo - <h1> to <h6> 
Headings help in emphasizing a section of text on a page
Sections can be separated by emphasis using different heading sizes.
Largest heading => most important section
Smallest heading => least important section
HTML Headings are created with h tags
H1 (<h1>) -> Largest most important heading
H6 (<h6>) -> Smallest, least important heading

  Code Demo - <p> & <br/>
Most HTML pages have blocks of text a.k.a. paragraphs.
To add paragraphs of text to our page, we use <p> tags
Browsers add some (vertical) whitespace before and after the paragraph block
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>Another lengthy paragraph can be here</p>

A paragraph starts on a new line by default.
If you want to start text from new line, BUT not change the paragraph, we use a <br/> or break tag.
<p>Another lengthy paragraph can be here.<br/>
    This will be in the same paragraph but new line</p>

  HTML Lists 
Often we need to provide a list on a page - for content or links
Two types of list
Unordered or Bulleted Lists created by <ul>
Ordered or Numbered Lists created by <ol>
Each item under the list must be enclosed in its own <li> tag to denote it as a list item.

  HTML Attributes
Attributes provides additional information about elements
Always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


  
  Web development - includes client-side and server-side development
Frontend development (client-side)	
HTML - Structure
CSS - Style
JS - Functionality
Browser (client) communicates with the server on your behalf
HTTP is the language of communication
Browser sends a request each for any extra information/resource it needs
HTML defines the content of  your webpage eg: images, buttons, links
Basic HTML structure
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>
The <!DOCTYPE html> tag lets the browser know it’s HTML5 format
<h1>, <h2>, …, <h6> tags are used for headings with decreasing font-size
<p> tag is for paragraph content and  <br> for adding a line break
Lists can be added using ul, ol tags with each item under li tag
Each HTML tag can have multiple attributes.
