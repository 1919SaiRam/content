An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers write, compile, and debug code more efficiently. IDEs are designed to support specific programming languages or related languages. 
Here are some features of IDEs:
Editors: Provide tools for writing and editing code, such as automatic line numbering, color coding, auto-correct, auto-suggestion, and auto-indent 
Build automation: Automate tasks like compiling source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests 
Debuggers: Test other programs and graphically display the location of bugs in the original code 
Version control: Track and manage changes to code 
Stepping: Monitor the effect of each line of code by executing a single line at a time 
Error message list: Display errors, warnings, and messages generated during compilation and execution 
Autocomplete: Anticipate what the programmer is going to type next 
IDEs can help programmers focus on logic in their code instead of learning about and manually integrating different software tools.
