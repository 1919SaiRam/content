An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers write, compile, and debug code more efficiently. IDEs are designed to support specific programming languages or related languages. 
Here are some features of IDEs:
Editors: Provide tools for writing and editing code, such as automatic line numbering, color coding, auto-correct, auto-suggestion, and auto-indent 
Build automation: Automate tasks like compiling source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests 
Debuggers: Test other programs and graphically display the location of bugs in the original code 
Version control: Track and manage changes to code 
Stepping: Monitor the effect of each line of code by executing a single line at a time 
Error message list: Display errors, warnings, and messages generated during compilation and execution 
Autocomplete: Anticipate what the programmer is going to type next 
IDEs can help programmers focus on logic in their code instead of learning about and manually integrating different software tools.  


  Alphabet 
a set of symbols used to build words of a certain language. Eg. The latin alphabet for English, Devanagari for Hindi, Kanji for Japanese, etc.

  Dictionary 
 a set of words that a language offers its users. Eg. The word “chat” is there in both English & French dictionary but having different meanings.

   Syntax
a set of rules used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence. “I am a Language” a syntactically correct while “I a Language am” isn’t.

  Semantics
 a set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense. Eg. “I ate a Burger” makes sense but “A burger ate me “ doesn’t.

   
 Variables to store and access data when a program is executing. 
  
Memory locations (where data is stored) have addresses
We need a reference to this memory location to access the value
This memory reference is called variable
When we create a variable, memory is reserved for this variable
Variable acts as a memory container that can store a value
