Use combination of these concepts to solve  problems.
Basic introduction to Javascript.
# -->  Programming is not difficult, if you have a strategy and practice :)


# What is the relation between Sequence and Algorithm?
Sequence is part of an algorithm.
Sequence is the order in which the instructions are executed.
While Algorithm is the sequence of instructions to achieve a task. 
When an Algorithm is written in a programming language we call it as Program.
There are many Programming languages like JavaScript, Java, Python, C++, Blockly etc.
Computer programs are algorithms written in programming languages that the computer can understand.

Debugging :- 
Errors are the problems or faults that occur in a program. These make the behavior of the program abnormal.
Programming errors are also known as the bugs. The process of finding & fixing these bugs is called debugging.
  
  programming languages that are known as high-level languages
  The language of 0s and 1s, which is called Binary Language
