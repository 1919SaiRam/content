Use combination of these concepts to solve  problems.
Basic introduction to Javascript.
# -->  Programming is not difficult, if you have a strategy and practice :)


# What is the relation between Sequence and Algorithm?
Sequence is part of an algorithm.
Sequence is the order in which the instructions are executed.
While Algorithm is the sequence of instructions to achieve a task. 
When an Algorithm is written in a programming language we call it as Program.
There are many Programming languages like JavaScript, Java, Python, C++, Blockly etc.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers write, compile, and debug code more efficiently. IDEs are designed to support specific programming languages or related languages. 
Here are some features of IDEs:
Editors: Provide tools for writing and editing code, such as automatic line numbering, color coding, auto-correct, auto-suggestion, and auto-indent 
Build automation: Automate tasks like compiling source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests 
Debuggers: Test other programs and graphically display the location of bugs in the original code 
Version control: Track and manage changes to code 
Stepping: Monitor the effect of each line of code by executing a single line at a time 
Error message list: Display errors, warnings, and messages generated during compilation and execution 
Autocomplete: Anticipate what the programmer is going to type next 
IDEs can help programmers focus on logic in their code instead of learning about and manually integrating different software tools.
