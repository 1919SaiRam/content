Basic introduction to Javascript.
# -->  Programming is not difficult, if you have a strategy and practice :)


# What is the relation between Sequence and Algorithm?
Sequence is part of an algorithm.
Sequence is the order in which the instructions are executed.
While Algorithm is the sequence of instructions to achieve a task. 
When an Algorithm is written in a programming language we call it as Program.
There are many Programming languages like JavaScript, Java, Python, C++, Blockly etc.
Computer programs are algorithms written in programming languages that the computer can understand.

Debugging :- 
Errors are the problems or faults that occur in a program. These make the behavior of the program abnormal.
Programming errors are also known as the bugs. The process of finding & fixing these bugs is called debugging.
  
  programming languages that are known as high-level languages
  The language of 0s and 1s, which is called Binary Language 

Compiler
The language processor that reads the program written in high-level language and translates it into an equivalent program in machine language is called a Compiler.  

  Keywords are reserved words used by the compiler. It tells the compiler that the keyword has a specific meaning AND it cannot be used for another purpose.

  
# Data Types in Javascript

String : A string is a series of characters like "Michael Jackson".
Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes. Example : “Crio”, ‘crio’.

Number : All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).
Numbers can be written with, or without decimals. Example : 34.00, 34

Boolean : Booleans can only have two values: true or false. 
For example: When you select Dark Mode or Light Mode on browser, the browser remembers it as Dark mode = True.

int: The integer data type represents a positive whole number or its negative value
Examples : -9834, 0,1, 87

float: It represents floating-point or decimal number.
Example : 0.1234, 12.245, -2324.0

boolean : booleans can only have two values: true or false. 
For example, when you select Dark Mode or Light Mode on browser, the browser remembers it as Dark mode = True.


Variables to store and access data when a program is executing.
