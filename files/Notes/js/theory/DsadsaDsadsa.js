  Introduction to Heaps
Heaps are the data structure that can access the maximum or minimum element very quickly
They are implemented using arrays (can also use linked lists). The Array Map of a Heap would like like this
You will notice that the heap can be visualized as a nearly complete binary tree.
Array Map
Root of the tree is the first element in the array corresponding to i = 1
The parent of node i = i / 2 → Index of parent node
Left child of node i = 2 * i → Index of left child
Right child of node i = 2 * i + 1 → Index of right child
