DSA (What? Why? How?)
How to master DSA?
Programming fundamentals
Crio DSA platform
Recap - Variables, syntax, data types, loops, conditional statements
Introduction to Space and Time Complexity
What is Time Complexity?
What is Space Complexity?
Tradeoff between the two

DSA :-
  
What?
Combination of Data Structures and Algorithms
Data structure: efficient data management to improve storage and retrieval
Algorithm: set of instructions to solve a particular problem

Why should you learn?
A building block of Software Development
Helps us keep our applications/softwares memory and time efficient
Helps shape our thought process - try to optimize our solution, suggest alternatives
Similar process is being followed in Software Development
Popular interview standard

How?
Consistency is the key, practice daily!!
Ensure that you solve problem on your own, do not copy-paste from internet
Ok to read/understand the solution, but please implement it on your own after that
We will share a methodology (a step by step process) that can be used to solve any problem
Avoid procrastination and stacking up the problems for the last week
Discuss your ideas with mentors/TAs/peers
  

----------->>>>>>>       Programming fundamentals
#Variables
Containers for storing data values

#Syntax
Each programming language has it own syntax (though there are a lot of similarity)
Get comfortable with the fundamentals

#Keywords: predefined, reserved words that have special meanings to the compiler

#Data types
Classification of data like: int, char, float, boolean

Further sub-division of data. 
Why do you think this sub classification is required? - Better memory management

Data types vs data structures?
  
#Constraints
Refers to restrictions, limitations.
Generally imposed on the input, helps us figure out the correct data type and algorithm
Example: the array given to you will have less than 10^6 elements

Debugging
Identification and removal of bugs/errors in the code
Important skill that comes when writing and executing code

------------->>>>>>>>>>> Programming Constructs

Conditionals: Helps in decision making 
If
switch
break
continue
Loops: Helps in iterating over a range
for
while
do while

If Else Block
Nested if else
Switch

Loops
Selection of a loop is always a tough task for a programmer, to select a loop do the following steps:
Analyze the problem and check whether it requires a pre-test or a post-test loop.
If pre-test is required, use a while or a for loop.
If post-test is required, use a do-while loop.
